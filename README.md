ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Welcome to my corner of GitHub!
Iâ€™m @vanFrZy, a curious soul passionate about Cybersecurity and Computer Science. Whether it's dissecting the latest vulnerabilities or building something cool from scratch, I love diving deep into the world of technology.

ðŸ’» By day: Iâ€™m a Pentester, exploring the fascinating world of both digital and physical security.

ðŸš€ By night: Iâ€™m sharpening my skills and trying to find bugs on the internet.

I enjoy experimenting with cutting-edge tech, breaking things (for educational purposes, of course!), and figuring out how they work under the hood.

ðŸ“« Feel free to connect, you can find my info over [here](https://www.windt.me).

Letâ€™s secure the digital realm together! ðŸ”’
